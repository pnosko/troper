    <p>A mechanic in tabletop and video games, particularly <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGames" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RolePlayingGames">RPGs</a>, where the players can put their characters in a resting mode to rapidly restore their health, stamina, mana, <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic">prepared spells</a>, etc. and reset any harmful <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StandardStatusEffects">Standard Status Effects</a>. </p>

    <p>Resting is usually only allowed under specific conditions, such as not being in combat or in view of any enemies, or even <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTents" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThereAreNoTents">only at fixed locations</a>, such as <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TraumaInn">inns</a>. Since the only resource consumed by resting is time (and money, in case of inns), this mechanic is usually found in conjunction with an <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverseGameClock" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InUniverseGameClock">In-Universe Game Clock</a> and may double as a <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastForwardMechanic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FastForwardMechanic">Fast-Forward Mechanic</a>. The necessity of resting may be enforced by characters suffering from negative status effects ("Tired", "Sleepy", etc.) after staying up for a while or by it being required to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUp">Level Up</a>; alternatively, resting may confer temporary positive status effects for a short while. </p>

    <p>Occasionally, the resting conditions (e.g. whether you rest outside or at an inn) affect the healing/restoration rate. Resting outside may run a risk of <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RandomEncounters">Random Encounters</a>, as enemies sneak up on the resting party, but staying inside <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnSecurity" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InnSecurity">doesn't always make you safe, either</a>. </p>

      <ul>
  
        <li> The <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TropeMaker">Trope Maker</a> is probably <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/DungeonsAndDragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a></em>, where all characters get tired after a certain time in the field and need regular rest to restore combat efficiency. Resting also restores some health and lets wizards and clerics <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic">re-memorize their spells</a>. In the 4th edition and later, there are two forms of rest. The shorter rest takes a small period of time but allows you to recover some hitpoints through a finite-day mechanic. The longer rest takes around 8 hours, and effectively restores your character to peak condition (barring bonuses that last until said rest or persistent conditions.) In the 1st and 2nd editions of the game, player characters could also regain one hit point a day doing normal activities, or three hit points if they spent the entire day resting (e.g., staying in bed, and only getting up to eat and drink), plus their constitution bonus, if any. This system might sound bad, but in earlier editions of the game characters had fewer hit points overall. Finally, any character that got four weeks of bed rest automatically got all their hit points back, regardless of how many they still needed to regain. </li>
  
        <li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ironclaw" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Ironclaw">Ironclaw</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MyriadSong" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/MyriadSong">Myriad Song</a></em>, it takes almost a month to recover from an "Injured" status simply with bed rest. Though medical treatment can speed it up. And in Ironclaw many of the more powerful spells (such as Healing) are recharged after a "respite". </li>
  
        <li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/EclipsePhase">Eclipse Phase</a></em>, normal humans heal about 5 hitpoints every 24 hours, while your bog-standard <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhuman" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Transhuman">Transhuman</a> can do that in 12. And that's not even getting into what <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NanoMachines" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/NanoMachines">Nano Machines</a> can do. </li>
  
        <li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HcSvntDracones" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/HcSvntDracones">Hc Svnt Dracones</a></em>, Vectors heal 2 hit points per night, unless they're at less than 50% HP in which case they need medical attention to heal at all. </li>
  
        <li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Numenera" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TabletopGame/Numenera">Numenera</a></em>, player characters can roll their Recovery dice to restore as many of their spent/lost stat pool points as they roll. The first time they do so on a given day, it only takes one (combat) action; the second time, a full ten minutes, then one hour, then a full night's rest of ten hours. A ten-hour rest resets the Recovery counter, so you can heal as a combat action again the next time. </li>

Time speeds up considerably when you do this and you'll be brought back to the start of the level when you're done, so you have to be careful not to overuse this feature. (The whole game is under a strict time limit, since your goal is to find and disarm a bomb hidden under the city.) Despite this, resting is still a better choice than getting defeated and captured, which will end up taking several hours off the in-game clock <em>and</em> bring you back to the start. </li>

As its description reads: "Make a cash offering and sleep on this mat, and your wounds will heal." In practice this means that you need to stay perfectly still while waiting your health to regenerate, losing money every second. Amaterasu's <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleAnimation" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/IdleAnimation">Idle Animation</a> is to sit down, yawn, then curl up for a nap (at which point the Wood Mat item kicks in).

        <li> In the <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ys" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Franchise/Ys">Ys</a></em> series, if you don't move for a bit, Adol will recover HP, but only outdoors for some reason.

The catch is that you must remain inside the field to heal and enemies can also be healed if they enter, so you have to keep enemies from coming in while at the same time you have limited movement if you want to maximize your recovery. </li>

That said, the <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PlayerCharacter">Player Character</a> never <em>needs</em> to rest and can stay awake for months at a time without penalty (as long as you have other means to restore health/magicka/stamina, like potions, and don't mind <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelRun" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LowLevelRun">never leveling up</a>). </li>

              <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Videogame/TheElderScrollsVSkyrim">Skyrim</a></em> changes the resting mechanic so that it is no longer necessary for leveling up. Instead, resting bestows a "well-rested" buff which temporarily allows skills to develop more quickly. If you get married, resting next to your spouse bestows the "Lover's Comfort" buff, further increasing the effect. However, being a Werewolf disables both of these buffs. </li>

          <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/TheWitcher">The Witcher</a></em> restricts the available resting locations to inns and a handful of friendly NPC's homes. While at rest, Geralt's health regenerates quickly and it also allows him to <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUp" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LevelUp">Level Up</a> and create potions and poisons. </li>

          <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout1">Fallout</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout2">2</a></em> had your health regeneration based on how long your character spent Resting. Sleeping healed all limbs and certain Perks allowed it to heal your radiation poisoning. <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/Fallout3">Fallout 3</a></em> and <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/FalloutNewVegas">New Vegas</a></em> removed the 'time spent' aspect, and thus an hour's nap after being shot to pieces will set you to full health. Sleeping in a bed you own will give you the "Well Rested" Status Effect, which grants a 30% increase in EXP gain (10% in <em>NV</em>). <em>New Vegas</em>' <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealityEnsues">Hardcore Mode</a> makes sleeping a requirement (too little and first you'll suffer stat loss and eventually even die) but also makes it so that resting no longer fixes ailments like broken limbs, requiring the use of doctor's bags or finding a medic. </li>
  
        <li> In Sierra's <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/QuestForGlory">Quest for Glory</a></em> series, you have the option to rest in increments ranging from "10 minutes" to "1 hour" to "until morning" (the last one being a good way to get killed by <a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsThatGoBumpInTheNight" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ThingsThatGoBumpInTheNight">Night Gaunts</a>). The game won't let you use this command if there's imminent danger nearby (such as a monster approaching). </li>
  
        <li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ADanceWithRogues" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ADanceWithRogues">A Dance with Rogues</a></em> resting functions the same way as in <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/NeverwinterNights">Neverwinter Nights</a></em> but you are very restricted in places where you can do so: apart from inns and your own and your allies' bedrooms, resting "on the ground" is permitted in a select few locations the Princess deems "safe"&mdash;everywhere else the resting button simply remains disabled. On one memorable occasion, a location is not flagged as "safe" until you close and lock the only door leading to it. </li>
  
        <li> 
          <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BetrayalAtKrondor" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/BetrayalAtKrondor">Betrayal at Krondor</a></em> allows you to rest to heal, but it reflects more realistic healing rates. It's faster in an inn, and if you've been critically injured then you will potentially take weeks or months of game time to recover. There are healing items, but they're not very effective (especially when you're in critical condition); while temples are effective but expensive. </li>
  
        <li> The later <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/MightAndMagic">Might and Magic</a></em> games all had this (no resting in combat, time moves forward a set amount, sleeping outside an inn risks random encounters), though with one additional quirk: sleeping in an inn costs money, but sleeping outside costs you <em>supplies</em> (generally represented by an apple, so it is presumably food), which can be bought from inns. This is enforced by the characters becoming weak if they spend too long without sleep, followed by going insane (and the spells that otherwise cure weakness and/or insanity does not work against sleep-deprivation caused afflictions). </li>
  
        <li> In <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/ArcanumOfSteamworksAndMagickObscura">Arcanum: Of Steamworks &amp; Magick Obscura</a></em> resting recovers hit points proportionally to the character's Heal Rate (based on the Constitution stat), whereas simply waiting only recovers stamina. One of the rest timer options is specifically "Sleep until healed", which wakes you up when the character with the slowest Heal Rate in the party gets to full health again. </li>
  
        <li> Both <em><a class="twikilink" href="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfPenAndPaper" title="/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/VideoGame/KnightsOfPenAndPaper">Knights of Pen and Paper</a></em> games allow your party to rest and rapidly recover any lost HP and MP. If done outside of the safety of a town, there is a random chance for the party to have their rest interrupted by monsters. </li>
